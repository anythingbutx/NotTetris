# NotTetris
A javascript web-based game in the style of tetris. Created using javaEE and Payara5 container.
Player scores are recorded and displayed on the scoreboard page ordered by rank.
Currently the scoreboard information is stored in memory via a static class serverside.
I will probably migrate the project to springboot before implementing hibranate and database connections.
